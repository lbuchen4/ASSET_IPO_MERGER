        The world of code can be overwhelming. Just like sexy yoga, the key is to breathe, and focus. <br>
        We will be focusing primarily on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="client">HTML</li>
        <li class="client">CSS</li>
        <li class="client">Javascript</li>
        <li class="server">PHP</li>
        <li class="server">MYSQL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <span class="client">maroon</span> ones are known as <em>client-side</em> languages. <br>
        They are interpretted by the web browser like chrome or firefux. <br>
        The <span class="server">blue</span> ones are called <em>server-side</em> languages. <br>
        Their functionality depends on little Chinese children in my basement. <br>
      </p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>Before we get dive in, we will need some tools to assist us on our journey.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer machine.</li>
        <li>A Text Editor - to type our code in.</li>
        <li>Xampp - to communicate with the Chinese children.</li>
        <li>Access to your command line - to feel like a legit hacker and use git.</li>
        <li>A Github account - no relation to "the Hub" hub.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a few other components to this setup that will make you want to quit before you start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</li>
        <li>Ngrok</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Best option might be to bring me your computer machine and I walk through it with you:</p>
