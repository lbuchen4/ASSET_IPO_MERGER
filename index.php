        In case this website has not already convinced you of my prowess, I will simply confirm, I am a coding Jedi. <br>
        Still not convinced? Watch this. <strong>Boom.</strong> Regard me please. <strong>Boom.</strong> <br>

       <p>
         Just because I tech sexy yoga you don't think I am capable of the coding? <br>
         <em>Fuck you.</em> Regard me please. Coding is basically sexy yoga for your computer machine. <br>
         And I am going to provide this safe space for all of us to practice, learn, grow and <strong>Boom</strong> together. <br>

      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>
        The world of code can be overwhelming. Just like sexy yoga, the key is to breathe, and focus. <br>
        We will be focusing primarily on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="client">HTML</li>
        <li class="client">CSS</li>
        <li class="client">Javascript</li>
        <li class="server">PHP</li>
        <li class="server">MYSQL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <span class="client">maroon</span> ones are known as <em>client-side</em> languages. <br>
        They are interpretted by the web browser like chrome or firefux. <br>
        The <span class="server">blue</span> ones are called <em>server-side</em> languages. <br>
        Their functionality depends on little Chinese children in my basement. <br>
      </p>

    <section class="tools">
      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>Before we get dive in, we will need some tools to assist us on our journey.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A computer machine.</li>
        <li>A Text Editor - to type our code in.</li>
        <li>Xampp - to communicate with the Chinese children.</li>
        <li>Access to your command line - to feel like a legit hacker and use git.</li>
        <li>A Github account - no relation to "the Hub" hub.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a few other components to this setup that will make you want to quit before you start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</li>
        <li>Ngrok</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Best option might be to bring me your computer machine and I walk through it with you:</p>

        Now, probably you are thinking: why tf would I want to waste sexy yoga time to type on my computer machine?
        This I also asked at first. But, regard me please. The coding is very <strong>powerful</strong>. <br>
        We can be making:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic Websites</li>
        <li>Webapps</li>
        <li>Databases Driven Thingys</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When we conquer this terrain we may tackle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swift Apps for iOS</li>
        <li>JAVA Apps for Android losers</li>
        <li>Artificially intelligent Python Programs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="start">
      So. Where to start? Regard me please. It is very imprtant that you learn the Git, CSS and HTML first. <br>
      You can be learning the HTML in 15 minutes. CSS will take 17. Git is a little trickier. <br>
      In theory you should be doing the Git first. But if you want to flex your sexy muscles, do the HTML and CSS first. <br>
      Try clicking on some of the links up above to see where I reccomend you start being the learning. <br>
      When you get the hang of those three, come back and try to make this page better (impossible). <br><br>
